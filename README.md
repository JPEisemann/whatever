This is a simple project I think is perfect for displaying the compacity for learning Go in a short period of time.  
 
Please implement a Golang based REST service which serves up one endpoint.  You can leverage https://iexcloud.io/ for stock information.
http://localhost:8000/stocks/{symbol} should return latest stock price based on the symbol provided.
 
You are limited to writing the rest server using the net/http package, do not use gorilla/mux or beego.
Bonus(optional):  

Implement in gomodules

Write unit tests

GRPC instead of REST
